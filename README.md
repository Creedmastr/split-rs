# Informations

This very small project (less than 150 lines) is just for decomposing big files into very small ones (you choose the number). This is completely lossless, and there will be not even a single byte missing.

# Usage

To use it, they are two methods.

### Split

`split split <file> <number_of_split> <split_dir>`


### Build

`split build <splitted_dir> <output_file>`
